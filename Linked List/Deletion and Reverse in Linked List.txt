Solution - 

class GFG
{
    //This method returns the head of the LL after deleting node with value d.
    public static Node deleteNode(Node head,int d)
    {
        //Add your code here.
        
        if(head == null || head.next == null) return head;
        
        if(head.data == d){
            Node curr = head;
            while(curr.next != head){
